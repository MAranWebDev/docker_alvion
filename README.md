# Project Alvion

## WARNING

- Git: changing names in local files/folders from mayusc/minusc makes the online repo to ignore the change. To avoid this, change to an alternate name, commit and then change it back to the wanted name
- "config/crontab_custom.conf", lines 3 & 4 needs to be uncommented for production
