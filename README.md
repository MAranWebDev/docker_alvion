# Project Alvion

## WARNING

- Git: changing names in local files/folders from mayusc/minusc makes the online repo to ignore the change. To avoid this, change to an alternate name, commit and then change it back to the wanted name
- "config/crontab_custom.conf", lines 3 & 4 needs to be uncommented for production

## Disclaimer

- This project was done to connect an e-commerce with different legacy systems around latam. You can't test the de sftp/ftp part (you need credentials for that), but you are free to check how the api rest and frontend works
